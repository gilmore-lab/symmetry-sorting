  abstract = {A traditional line of work starting with the Gestalt school has shown that patterns vary in strength and salience; a difference in “Perceptual goodness.” The Holographic weight of evidence model quantifies goodness of visual regularities. The key formula states that W = E/N, where E is number of holographic identities in a pattern and N is number of elements. We tested whether W predicts the amplitude of the neural response to regularity in an extrastriate symmetry-sensitive network. We recorded an Event Related Potential (ERP) generated by symmetry called the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN). First, we reanalyzed the published work and found that W explained most variance in SPN amplitude. Then in four new studies, we confirmed specific predictions of the holographic model regarding 1) the differential effects of numerosity on reflection and repetition, 2) the similarity between reflection and Glass patterns, 3) multiple symmetries, and 4) symmetry and anti-symmetry. In all cases, the holographic approach predicted SPN amplitude remarkably well; particularly in an early window around 300–400 ms post stimulus onset. Although the holographic model was not conceived as a model of neural processing, it captures many details of the brain response to symmetry.},

  abstract = {Goodness is a classic Gestalt notion defined as salience or perceptual strength of a given pattern. All operational models of goodness have assigned a central role to mirror symmetry but not much attention has been paid to the distinction between global and local mirror symmetry, and their possible interactions. We designed eight different types of dot patterns (all consisting of 80 dots), combining different numbers (0, 1, and 2) and relative orientations (parallel or orthogonal to each other) of local and global axes of symmetry (affecting 50\% or 100\% of the dots, respectively) at different absolute orientations (vertical and horizontal). Each of 640 trials consisted of a short presentation of a new dot pattern, which subjects had to classify as regular or random. We hypothesised that the overall goodness of patterns is not the simple sum of the amount of regularity present in them but depends on the cooperation and competition between symmetries. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that performance in this regularity-detection task did not increase in a linear way when some symmetries were added to other symmetries.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the transformational approach provided the only available formal analysis of visual regularities like repetition and mirror symmetry. This theoretical study presents a new analysis, based on the recently developed concept of holographic regularity. This concept applies to the intrinsic character of regularity and specifies the unique formal status of perceptually relevant regularities. The crucial point is that the two analyses imply the same structure for repetition but a different structure for mirror symmetry. Transformationally, mirror symmetry is an all-or-nothing property, whereas holographically, it is a graded property. This difference pervades the understanding of both perfect regularities and perturbed regularities. Whereas the transformational approach explains hardly any goodness phenomenon, the holographic approach explains a wide variety of goodness phenomena in a coherent way that is ecologically plausible as well.

Visual symmetry is a useful tool to study gestalt formation, and we know that there are symmetry-sensitive regions in the extrastriate cortex. However, it is unclear whether symmetrical gestalt formation happens automatically, whatever the participant's current task is. Does the visual brain always organize and interpret the retinal image when possible, or only when necessary? To test this, we recorded an ERP called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN). SPN amplitude increases with the proportion of symmetry in symmetry + noise displays. We compared the SPN across five tasks with different cognitive and perceptual demands. Contrary to our predictions, the SPN was the same across four of the five tasks but selectively enhanced during active regularity discrimination. Furthermore, during regularity discrimination, the SPN was present on hit trials and false alarm trials but absent on miss and correct rejection trials. We conclude that gestalt formation is automatic and task-independent, although it occasionally fails on miss trials. However, it can be enhanced by attention to visual regularity.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging work has shown that visual symmetry activates extrastriate brain areas, most consistently the lateral occipital complex (LOC). LOC activation increases with proportion of symmetrical dots (pSymm) in a degraded display. In the current work, we recorded a posterior ERP called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN), which is relatively negative for symmetrical compared to random patterns. We predicted that SPN would also scale with pSymm, because it is probably generated by the LOC. Twenty-four participants viewed dot patterns with different levels of regularity: 0\% regularity (full random configuration) 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% (full reflection symmetry). Participants judged if the pattern contained “some regularity” or “no regularity”. As expected, the SPN amplitude increased with pSymm, while the latency and duration was the same in all conditions. The SPN was independent of the participant’s decision, and it was present on some trials where people reported ‘no-regularity’. We conclude that the SPN is generated at an intermediate stage of visual processing, probably in the LOC, where perceptual goodness is represented. This comes after initial visual analysis, but before subsequent decision stages, which apply a threshold to the analog LOC response.},

We were interested in the neural correlates of these perceptual effects. Participants viewed random, reflection, rotation, and translation patterns while we recorded EEG from the scalp. Half the participants classified the pattern regularity overtly, the other half did not explicitly attend to pattern regularity but reported rare oddball trials, where two squares were embedded among the dots. The amplitude of a symmetry-related ERP known as the sustained posterior negativity was most pronounced for reflection, then rotation and translation. We suggest that reflectional symmetry, despite its biological significance, may not be processed by unique visual mechanisms, but instead it could be a preferred stimulus for a more general regularity-sensitive network in the extrastriate visual cortex.},

Participants viewed symmetrical or random dot patterns, either in a frontoparallel or slanted plane (±50°). One group performed a color discrimination task, while another performed a regularity discrimination task. We measured a symmetry-related event-related potential (ERP), beginning around 300 ms. During color discrimination, the ERP was reduced for slanted patterns, indexing only the remaining retinal structure. During regularity discrimination, the same ERP was view invariant, and identical for frontoparallel or slanted presentation. We conclude that normalization occurs rapidly during active symmetry discrimination, while symmetry-sensitive networks respond only to regularity in the retinal image when people are attending to other features.},

  abstract = {Conducted 3 experiments with 14 Ss to measure the time to detect symmetries in square field patterns. The same relationships among mean detection times (DTs) for different symmetries were found in both well-practiced and naive Ss. When the task was to detect any symmetry, DTs were faster for multiple symmetric patterns than for singly symmetric ones. Horizontal–vertical symmetry was faster than diagonal, which was faster than centric. When the task was to detect specific symmetry—that is, vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or centric only—DTs were faster again for multiple symmetric patterns, suggesting that "irrelevant" symmetry facilitated performance. Errors and response times indicate that certain symmetries were more difficult to reject than others, depending on the type of symmetry. Results suggest interference effects arising from certain symmetries and are best accounted for by a model in which symmetry is encoded integrally. Thus, when decoding is required by the task, as in detection tasks, S performs a serial, hierarchical decomposition of the code.

Palumbo recently demonstrated that the presence or absence of abstract reflectional symmetry also influenced subjective duration. Here, we explored this phenomenon further by varying the type of symmetry (reflection or rotation) and the objective duration of stimulus presentation (less or more than 1 second). Experiment 1 used a verbal estimation task in which participants estimated the presentation duration of reflection, rotation symmetry, or random square-field patterns. Longer estimates were given for reflectional symmetry images than rotation or random, but only when the image was presented for less than 1 second. There was no difference between rotation and random. These findings were confirmed by a second experiment using a paired-comparison task. This temporal distortion could be because reflection has positive valence or because it is processed efficiently be the visual system. The mechanism remains to be determined. We are relatively sure, however, that reflectional patterns can increase subjective duration in the absence of explicit semantic content, and in the absence of changes in the size, luminance, or numerosity in the images.},

The patterns were invariant for transformations of rotation or reflection, and formed symmetry groups of different orders, i.e., cyclic and dihedral groups. The complexity and goodness of the patterns depended upon such stimulus variables as follows: (1) complexity decreased with the order of symmetry groups with equal weights for cyclic and dihedral groups, whereas goodness increased with the order of both symmetry groups with different weights; (2) the simplicity and goodness of patterns with a vertical axis were greater than those with a horizontal axis and those with an oblique one; (3) the complexity of the patterns that had collinear elements with equal length was rated the simplest; (4) pattern goodness increased as a function of the number of dots and the concentrations of dot to rotation/reflection axis in 3 x 3 and 4 × 4 matrices. Thus, complexity and goodness of pattern differed with respect to these stimulus variables.},

This could reflect temporary enhancement of contralateral visual inputs and specifically a shift of attention to the left, or right hemisphere specialization for regularity discrimination. This study tested these competing hypotheses. Twenty-four participants discriminated between dot patterns containing a reflection or a translation. The direction of the transformation, which matched one half onto the other half, was either vertical or horizontal. The strategy of shifting attention to one side of the patterns would not produce lateralized ERD in the horizontal condition. However, right-lateralized ERD was found in all conditions, regardless of orientation. We conclude that right hemisphere networks that incorporate the early posterior regions are specialized for regularity discrimination.},

Although symmetry is known to be an important determinant of aesthetic preference, previous studies have concluded that evaluation does not occur spontaneously. These studies also found that symmetrical and random patterns do not differ in terms of early sensory processing, within 200ms of stimulus onset. We presented participants with symmetrical or random abstract patterns, which they had to classify correctly. Contrary to previous work, we found that N1 amplitude was sensitive to all types of regularity, and P1 was sensitive to rotational symmetry. We also found that activity in the Zygomaticus Major, the facial muscle responsible for smiling, was greater for reflection patterns. However, we were able to reverse this effect by changing the task so that participants had to treat random patterns as the target stimuli. We conclude that participants spontaneously select reflectional symmetry as the target, and positive affective responses automatically follow from successful target detection. This work provides a new account of the neural mechanisms involved in visual symmetry perception.},

Symmetry perception has been demonstrated in humans5–8, birds9–11, dolphins12 and apes13. Here we show that bees trained to discriminate bilaterally symmetrical from non-symmetrical patterns learn the task and transfer it appropriately to novel stimuli, thus demonstrating a capacity to detect and generalize symmetry or asymmetry. We conclude that bees, and possibly flower-visiting insects in general, can acquire a generalized preference towards symmetrical or, alternatively, asymmetrical patterns depending on experience, and that symmetry detection is preformed or can be learned as a perceptual category by insects, because it can be extracted as an independent visual pattern feature. Bees show a predisposition for learning and generalizing symmetry because, if trained to it, they choose it more frequently, come closer to and hover longer in front of the novel symmetrical stimuli than the bees trained for asymmetry do for the novel asymmetrical stimuli. Thus, even organisms with comparatively small nervous systems can generalize about symmetry, and favour symmetrical over asymmetrical patterns.},

We tested the hypothesis thatX.cortezifemales prefer males with a symmetrical bar number by determining whether females switched their preference between two males when we switched which male had a symmetrical number of bars. The ability to manipulate the bars without influencing other male traits allowed us to control for male characters correlated with bar symmetry that females might prefer. The degree of asymmetry in bar number we used was within the degree of asymmetry found for this trait in nature. Females switched their preference between a pair of males when we switched which male was symmetrical for bar number.

  abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry is defined as random deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry in otherwise symmetrical morphological traits and originates from developmental errors during ontogeny. It is thought to reflect the inability of a genotype to buffer itself effectively against environmental perturbations, thus providing an honest phenotypic indicator of genetic quality. It has been proposed that females use the degree of asymmetry in male ornaments to assess male quality in mate choice. We studied whether fluctuating asymmetry in vertical bars in the sailfin molly,Poecilia latipinna, is a criterion in female mate preference, as has been shown before in a swordtail,Xiphophorus cortezi. Using both live stimulus males and silicon models, we found that females have significant preferences both for bars per se and for males with symmetrical bars. The total number of bars and the degree of fluctuating asymmetry were negatively related so fluctuating asymmetry in bars may be an honest signal. This phenomenon may have influenced the evolution of the male courtship display inP.latipinna.},

  abstract = {FLUCTUATING asymmetries are the small random deviations from symmetry that occur in the development of bilaterally symmetrical traits1. Such asymmetries are believed to be a direct indicator of phenotypic, perhaps genotypic, quality2. Relative levels of asymmetry are much greater in secondary sexual characters than in normal morphological traits2. It has been proposed that females use the amount of asymmetry in secondary sexual ornamentation as a cue in mate choice3, because the highest quality individuals have the most symmetrical, as well as elaborate, ornaments2–10. Using a choice chamber similar to that in ref. 11, we show here that female zebra finches choose symmetrically leg-banded males over asymmetrically banded ones. This demonstrates unequivocally that females use symmetry as a criterion in partner preference, although whether the symmetry preference is specific to secondary sexual characters is unknown.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary, as well as cultural, pressures may contribute to our perceptions of facial attractiveness. Biologists predict that facial symmetry should be attractive, because it may signal mate quality. We tested the prediction that facial symmetry is attractive by manipulating the symmetry of individual faces and observing the effect on attractiveness, and by examining whether natural variations in symmetry (between faces) correlated with perceived attractiveness. Attractiveness increased when we increased symmetry, and decreased when we reduced symmetry, in individual faces (Experiment 1), and natural variations in symmetry correlated significantly with attractiveness (Experiments 1 and 1A). Perfectly symmetric versions, made by blending the normal and mirror images of each face, were preferred to less symmetric versions of the same faces (even when those versions were also blends) (Experiments 1 and 2). Similar results were found when subjects judged the faces on appeal as a potential life partner, suggesting that facial symmetry may affect human mate choice. We conclude that facial symmetry is attractive and discuss the possibility that this preference for symmetry may be biologically based.},

  abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Symmetry is a highly salient feature of the natural world that is perceived by many species of the animal kingdom and that impacts a large array of behaviours such as partner selection or food choice. In humans, the cerebral areas processing symmetry are now well identified from neuroimaging measurements. However, we currently lack an animal model to explore the underlying neural mechanisms. Macaque is a potentially good candidate, but a previous comparative study (1) found that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to mirror symmetry in this species were substantially weaker than those observed in humans under similar experimental conditions. Here, we re-examined symmetry processing in macaques from a broader perspective, using both rotation (experiment 1) and reflection (experiment 2) symmetry. Our experimental design was directly derived from that of a previous human fMRI study (2), in order to facilitate the comparison between the two primate species. Highly consistent responses to symmetry were found in a large network of areas (notably V3, V3A, V4, V4A and PITd), in line with what has been observed in humans. Within this network, response properties in areas V3 and V4 (notably their dependency on the rotation symmetry order) were strikingly similar to those observed in their human counterparts. Our results suggest that the cortical networks that process symmetry in humans and macaques are much more similar than previously reported and point toward macaque as a relevant model for understanding symmetry processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Symmetry processing is an important aspect of human visual perception. We currently lack an animal model for characterizing the neural mechanisms that underlie it at the microscopic scale. Here, we use fMRI measurements in macaques to demonstrate that the cortical responses to symmetry in this species are comparable to those observed in humans under similar experimental conditions to a much higher extent than previously documented. Our results call for a re-examination of the relevance of the macaque model for symmetry processing in humans and open the door to an exploration of the underlying neural mechanisms at the single-cell level, notably in V3, an area often neglected in most current models of visual processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
